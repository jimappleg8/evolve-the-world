# Work The Needs Doing

These are ways that you can contribute to this project by including us in your creative practice:

## Help build this website

- Expand the content of this site to make it clearer what we are trying to do and how visits can help us accomplish it. This site started as a minimum viable artifact, and can certainly be improved.
- Articles: Not so much a blog, but a set of articles that help explain what we're trying to do, and more importantly, how our visitors can go from not having a coherent creative practice to being a member of the evolutionary design movement.
- Improve the design of the website. The website is based on the Reveal Website Template. Ideally, we would revise the design to make it unique to this project. It could also be used as the design for the Open Artifacts Starter Project.
