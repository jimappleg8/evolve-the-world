        <h2>What evolutionary design could do</h2>
        <p>This is written in the present tense, but we need your help to make it reality.</p>

        <p>We are the Cultural Creatives. Our life experience has taught us to question what we think we know about the world and how it works. It gives us a perspective that allows us to see more clearly, not only the world as it is, but the world as it could be.</p>

        <p>We engage in Evolutionary Design with the hope that we'll realize our vision of a better world, where all humanity survives and thrives, on a flourishing Earth, far into the future.</p>

        <p>The work of evolutionary design requires independent thought, humility and personal integrity, so we continually question what we think we know about the world and how it works. We refer to this life long exercise in personal sovereignty as <i>strengthening our Personal Universe</i>. The assumption is that the more comprehensive, accurate, integrated and flexible our understanding of Universe is, the more effective we'll be at creating the change that we want to see.</p>

        <p>At the heart of our activism is our Creative Practice, a cyclical process in which we use our creative energy to both strengthen our personal universe and help build a better world. The practice is fairly simple, but it contains seeds of self-actualization that can provide a lifetime of meaningful work. It consists of finding work that needs doing, deciding what work is ours to do, doing that work, and communicating what we've learned to the world.</p>

        <p>Our creative practice makes it possible for us to contribute the best of our hard-won experience, knowledge and skills to creating a better world, while leaving us in control of what we contribute and how we contribute it.</p>

        <p>Our willingness to engage in our creative practice makes us part of an extensive and diverse community of evolutionary designers, all working for peaceful cultural change in a great global collaboration. We're interconnected by a vast web of Open Artifacts projects that provide online collaborative spaces in which we can develop our ideas and learn from each other. Open artifacts enable us to contribute our best knowledge, skills and experience to multiple projects, while letting us decide how much time we can spend, when we can do the work, and which projects we participate in.</p>

        <p>Many of us work closely with our neighbors in Cultural Creators' Groups, drawing upon the group's diverse knowledge, skills and experience to improve the communities we live in. When we identify a community need, we look for existing open artifacts projects that we can adapt. If a suitable project doesn't exist, we create it. Regardless, we always share what we learn with the world by creating, contributing to or adapting and implementing open artifacts projects.</p>

        <p>We are the engine that drives the design revolution, global regeneration, and collective actualization movements that are transforming our world from the inside out. We are the collective experience and creative energy of millions of people, directed toward creating new world systems based on equity, justice, and the common good. As these new systems develop and are adapted to local conditions around the world, they're replacing the old world systems by making them obsolete. The world is evolving toward the world we have envisioned together. It will continue to do so as future generations take what we've built and improve it, moving humanity ever forward.</p>
